This is an experiment about four different approaches to upsert records from a CSV file into a database.
* Batch component.
* Manual pagination.
* Hybrid of the two above.
* Resilient manual pagination.

The complementary article about resilient manual batch is here http://blog.ioconnectservices.com/2017/08/mule-batch-adding-resiliency-to-manual.html.

The samples here depicted use the CSVs files in https://github.com/ioconnectservices/csvs repo.
